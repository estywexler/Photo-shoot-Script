Intro:

The class photoshoot calculates the Dof, Far and NEAR points and prints it out when you print the instance (with a magic toString function).
this is base on after the settings of a photoshoot are defined.

I added the class recommends - that gives you recommendations on how to set your camera Before taking a photoshoot.

1) function mode and settings:
    case scenario1: you are a beginner, you don't want to use the auto mode, but not ready to use the manual mode.
    case scenario2: you are too lazy right now to use the manual mode.
    
    the solution is to use A/AV or S/TV but wich one of them to use?
    and what should be the first value to set, that the camera will rely on?
    this function will give you the answer based on the environment settings.
    these settings will give you a  good start point.

2) function distance_with_flash
    will define what distance you can shoot in based on your flash and your aperture settings.
